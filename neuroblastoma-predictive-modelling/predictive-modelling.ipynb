    "### Project Objective:\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict clinical outcomes in neuroblastoma patients using RNA-Seq gene expression data. Several clinical outcome fields contain missing values. This project aims to train a model that can accurately predict those outcomes and impute the missing values accordingly.\n",

    "- **Explore and understand** the dataset to identify patterns, distributions, and any preprocessing needs.\n",

    "    - This model is good at identifying actual progression cases (recall = 0.89), meaning few false negatives and many true positives.\n",
    "    - The precision for progression is lower (0.59), indicating many false positives. This means this model often predicts disease progression even though it is an incorrect prediction.\n",
    "    - This model is useful when catching progression cases is more important than avoiding false alarms."
