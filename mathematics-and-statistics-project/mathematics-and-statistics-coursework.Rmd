Q1. Examine the given piece of code which simulates from a simplified version of the Markov Chain. Also, work the values for a and b in the code below.
```{r}
#1. Setting seed and declaring variables:
set.seed(42)      # set seed to generate same sequence of random numbers.
a <- 0.799        # probability of state 1 transitioning into itself.
b <- 0.79         # probability of state 2 transitioning into itself.
n_days <- 400     # number of days in this simulation.

# create a transition matrix with probability weights. 
transition_matrix <- matrix(c(a, 0.2, 0.001, 
                              0.2, b, 0.01, 
                              0, 0, 1), nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)

state <- 1                          # initial state of the patient.
patient_record <- rep(0, n_days)    # vector to store state of patient for each day.


#2. For loop iterating days and recording changes in state:
for (day in 1:n_days) {                         # loop iterating over each day from 1 to n_days.
  pr <- transition_matrix[state, ]              # extract row from matrix for current state.
                                                
  state <- sample(c(1:3), size = 1, prob = pr)  # select one number from 1 to 3 according                                                                                                                # to the probabilities mentioned in pr.
  patient_record[day] <- state                  # record current state in vector for each day.
}


#3. Plotting our simulation:
plot(1:n_days, patient_record, "l")    # line plot with number of days on x-axis and patient                                                                                                    # record on y-axis.
```

Comment: The plot shows the states of the patient (y-axis) from day 1 to 400 (x-axis). The state of the patient changes from healthy (1) to sick (2) and then finally dead (3). According to the probability weights the states change from 1, 2 to 3, since state 3 cannot transition into any other states, the state of the patient remains 3.

```{r}
#4. Finding out the exact day the patient transitioned to state 3:
# Setting seed and declaring variables:
set.seed(42)      # set seed to generate same sequence of random numbers.
a <- 0.799        # probability of state 1 transitioning into itself.
b <- 0.79         # probability of state 2 transitioning into itself.
n_days <- 400     # number of days in this simulation.

# create a transition matrix with probability weights. 
transition_matrix <- matrix(c(a, 0.2, 0.001, 
                              0.2, b, 0.01, 
                              0, 0, 1), nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)

state <- 1                          # initial state of the patient.
patient_record <- rep(0, n_days)    # vector to store state of patient for each day.
transition_day <- NA                # initialize variable to store the transition day

for (day in 1:n_days) {
  pr <- transition_matrix[state, ]              
  state <- sample(c(1:3), size = 1, prob = pr)  

  # record current state in vector for each day
  patient_record[day] <- state 
  
  # check if the patient transitioned to state 3
  if (state == 3) {
    transition_day <- day
    break  # exit the loop once the transition is found
  }
}

# print the day when the patient first transitions to state 3
cat("Patient transitioned to state 3 on day:", transition_day, "\n")
```





Q2. Extend the code above to incorporate the 4th state creating a 4x4 transition matrix, based on the 4 state Markov Chain. Plot the resulting patient record and comment on the plot. 
```{r}
#1. Setting seed and declaring variables:
set.seed(42)      # set seed to generate same sequence of random numbers.
a <- 0.799        # probability of state 1 transitioning into itself.
b <- 0.69         # probability of state 2 transitioning into itself.
c <- 0.5          # probability of state 3 transitioning into itself.
n_days <- 400     # number of days in this simulation.

# create a transition matrix with probability weights. 
transition_matrix <- matrix(c(a, 0.2, 0, 0.001, 
                              0.2, b, 0.1, 0.01,
                              0.1, 0.2, c, 0.2,
                              0, 0, 0, 1), nrow=4, ncol=4, byrow=TRUE)

state <- 1                          # initial state of the patient.
patient_record <- rep(0, n_days)    # vector to store state of patient for each day.


#2. For loop iterating days and recording changes in state:
for (day in 1:n_days) {                         # loop iterating over each day from 1 to n_days.
  pr <- transition_matrix[state, ]              # extract row from matrix for current state.
                                                
  state <- sample(c(1:4), size = 1, prob = pr)  # select one number from 1 to 3 according                                                                                                                # to the probabilities mentioned in pr.
  patient_record[day] <- state                  # record current state in vector for each day.
}


#3. Plotting our simulation:
plot(1:n_days, patient_record, "l")    # line plot with number of days on x-axis and patient                                                                                                    # record on y-axis.
```


Comment: The plot shows the states of the patient (y-axis) from day 1 to 400 (x-axis). The state of the patient varies from healthy (1), sick (2), hospital (3) and then finally dead (4). According to the probability weights the states change from 1, 2, 3, to 4 since state 4 cannot transition into any other states, the state of the patient remains 4.





Q3. Use your code from Q2 to simulate 1000 patient records. Plot the distribution of the number of days spent in each state. Comment on the results.
```{r}
#1. Setting seed and declaring variables:
set.seed(42)        # set seed to generate same sequence of random numbers.
a <- 0.799          # probability of state 1 transitioning into itself.
b <- 0.69           # probability of state 2 transitioning into itself.
c <- 0.5            # probability of state 3 transitioning into itself.
n_days <- 400       # number of days in this simulation.
n_patients <- 1000  # number of patients

# create a transition matrix with probability weights. 
transition_matrix <- matrix(c(a, 0.2, 0, 0.001, 
                              0.2, b, 0.1, 0.01,
                              0.1, 0.2, c, 0.2,
                              0, 0, 0, 1), nrow=4, ncol=4, byrow=TRUE)

# create a matrix to store records for all patients.
all_patients_records <- matrix(0, nrow = n_days, ncol = n_patients)


#2. For loop iterating days and recording changes in state:

# outer loop
for (patients in 1:n_patients) {
  state <- 1                          # initial state of the patients.
  patient_record <- rep(0, n_days)    # vector to store state of patients for each day.
  
  # inner loop
  for (day in 1:n_days) {                         # loop iterating over each day from 1 to                                                                                                                 # n_days.
  pr <- transition_matrix[state, ]                # extract row from matrix for current state.
                                                
  state <- sample(c(1:4), size = 1, prob = pr)    # select one number from 1 to 4 according                                                                                                                # to the probabilities mentioned in pr.
  patient_record[day] <- state                    # record current state in vector for each day.
  }
  all_patients_records[, patients] <- patient_record  # store the patient record in the matrix
}

#3. Plotting our simulation:

# Plot no. 1:
# Install and load reshape2 and ggplot2 packages
#install.packages("reshape2")
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)

# Melting our data into a data frame
melted_data <- melt(all_patients_records)

# Assuming melted_data is your melted data frame
ggplot(melted_data, aes(x = Var1, fill = factor(value, labels = c("State 1", "State 2", "State 3", "State 4")))) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") +
  labs(title = "State Transitions for 1000 Patients",
       x = "Days", y = "Count") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("State 1" = "blue", "State 2" = "green", "State 3" = "red", "State 4" = "purple"),

# Plot no. 2: 
set.seed(45)
# Select random 10 patients with the same seed
random_patient_indices <- sample(1:n_patients, 10)

# Create a histogram for each selected patient

for (i in 1:10) {
  patient_index <- random_patient_indices[i]
  patient_record <- all_patients_records[, patient_index]
  
  hist(patient_record, main = paste("Patient", patient_index), 
       xlab = "Days", ylab = "Frequency", col = i, border = "black")

  # Print out the number of days spent in each state for the current patient
  cat("Patient", patient_index, "Days in each state:\n")
  print(table(factor(patient_record, levels = 1:4)))
  cat("\n")
}

```


Comment:

1. Plot 1: This plot shows the number of days each patient is spending in a particular state. The frequency of patients in State 4 goes on increasing while it drops steadily in the other states. This is due to the fact that a patient cannot transition out of State 4 into any other states.

2. Plot 2: This histogram of 10 random patients also shows the number of days each patient is spending in a particular State. I have also included the exact number of days each of these 10 patients have spent in a particular State. We can see that all patients are spending majority of their days in State 4, this is because State 3 has a higher probability, than other states, of transitioning to State 4 and no probability of transitioning to another state.





Q4. Study the following code example and add comments to describe what it does: 
```{r}
# ------------- Part 1 -------------
library(tidyverse)                   # load library tidyverse.

#view(Y)                             # for viewing the matrix Y.

pca_x  <- t(log(Y + 1))    # log transformation of Y to make data more symmetric for PCA. 
pca_res1 <- prcomp(pca_x, scale = TRUE, center = TRUE)    # perform PCA with unit variance.

#view(pca_res1$x) 
#view(patient_data$patient)
pca_df1 <- data.frame(    
  pca_res1$x,
  tissue = patient_data$tissue,
  patient = patient_data$patient)
#view(pca_df1)


# plotting with ggplot2 package. 
# use PC1 on x-axis, PC2 on y-axis, colour according to the variable tissue
ggplot(pca_df1, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = tissue)) +  
  geom_point(size = 3) +    #add a layer of size 3 to the plot to display points.
  theme_bw() +    #apply black and white theme
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2") +    #label x-axis as PC1 and y-axis as PC2.

# ------------- Part 2 -------------
library(MASS)    # load MASS library with functions for statistics and data analysis.
idx <- 20    # set value of 20 to variable idx, later used to make the tmp data frame.
c_cl <- 1:20    # create a vector c_cl with integers 1 to 20. 
x <- patient_data$tissue[c_cl]    # extract tissue column with rows specified by c_cl and store as x.
z <- patient_data$patient[c_cl]   # extract patient column with rows specified by c_cl and store as z.
view(patient_data$patient)
# create a data frame with y as Y matrix with the 'idx' row and 'c_cl' columns. x as variable x, z as variable z. the variable lib_size stores the sum of columns of matrix Y as specified by c_cl vector.
tmp <- data.frame(y = Y[idx, c_cl], x = x, z = z, lib_size = colSums(Y[, c_cl]))

# use glm (generalised linear model) function to fit a poisson regression model. 
# y ~ x + z + lib_size is the formula for the model to be fit.
# data is take from the variable tmp, family argument specifies which type of model should be used.
out <- glm(y ~ x + z + lib_size, data = tmp, family = "poisson")

# make summary of 'out' and access the 2nd row and 4th column of coefficients table, which is the p-value. 
p_val <- summary(out)$coefficients[2, 4]
#summary(out)
```


Comment: This scatter plot shows the relationship between the samples where normal and tumour samples have been coloured with different colours respectively. This plot is the result of Principal Component Analysis and we are visualising principal components 1 and 2 (PC1, PC2 respectively).





Q5. Using the code from Q4 part 1, perform dimensionality reduction using principal components analysis (PCA) for the full data matrix provided.

a. Plot a scatter plot in the first two principal components.
b. Identify any problematic samples exploring the scatter plot visually.
c. Explain briefly why the samples are problematic.
d. Remove problematic sample pairs from further analysis. 
```{r}
# ------------- Part 1 -------------
library(tidyverse)                   # Load library tidyverse.                  
load("assess_data_resit-23.Rdata")   # Load data from  the given file.
#view(Y)                             # for viewing the matrix Y.

pca_x  <- t(log(Y + 1))    # Log transformation of Y to make data more symmetric for PCA. 
pca_res1 <- prcomp(pca_x, scale = TRUE, center = TRUE)    # Perform PCA with unit variance. 


# Creating a data frame pca_df1 with the combined principal component scores of pca_res1 and adding two columns of data, tissue from patient_data and patient from patient_data. 
#view(pca_res1$x) 
#view(patient_data$patient)
pca_df1 <- data.frame(    
  pca_res1$x,
  tissue = patient_data$tissue,
  patient = patient_data$patient,
  sample_names = patient_data$sample_id)  # Adding 'sample_names' column to help plot names on plot points.
#view(pca_df1)


#a. Plot a scatter plot in the first two principal components:
# Plotting with ggplot2 package. 
# Use PC1 on x-axis, PC2 on y-axis, colour according to the variable tissue
ggplot(pca_df1, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = tissue, label = sample_names)) +  
  geom_point(size = 1) +    # Add a layer of size 1 to the plot to display points.
  theme_bw() +    # Apply black and white theme
  geom_text(aes(label = sample_names), hjust = 0, vjust = 0) +  # Add text to our points using column 'sample_names'
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA - Labelled points") +    # Label x-axis as PC1 and y-axis as PC2.
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")    # Display legend at bottom of plot.
```



#b. Identify any problematic samples exploring the scatter plot visually:
Looking at the plot, there are two obvious outliers. The samples causing the issue are Sample014 and Sample016. These outliers are from two patients, Patient 1 and Patient 14.

#c. Explain briefly why the samples are problematic:
Sample014 and Sample016 are outliers, they disproportionately influence the principal components and they do not represent the overall structure of the data. Hence, they must be removed. If we remove Sample014 and Sample016, we also need to remove the pair of the sample too. The pair of Sample014 is Sample029 and the pair of Sample016 is Sample001. We can check this by viewing patient_data. To remove these outliers, we can use two methods: 

1. We can set up a threshold value using the filter function, any value above this threshold would be considered an outlier. Since, in our plot, the value of Sample014 is higher than 40 and the value of Sample016 is less than -20, we can set our threshold at 40 and -20 respectively. Although, this in itself will not get rid of the sample pairs.

2. Since we know our problematic samples and their sample pairs, we can create a vector and assign our samples to that vector, then we can use the filter function to filter out those samples.

```{r}
#d. Method 1:
pca_df1_thres_fil <- pca_df1 %>%
  filter(PC2 <= 40, PC2 >= -20) 
#view(pca_df1_filtered)    # Only Sample014 and Sample016 have been removed.

# Using the same code for our previous plot, only with pca_df1_thres_filt instead of pca_df1.
# Removed comments to make less cluttered.
ggplot(pca_df1_thres_fil, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = tissue, label = sample_names)) +  
  geom_point(size = 1) +    
  theme_bw() +             
  geom_text(aes(label = sample_names), hjust = 0, vjust = 0) +  
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA - Outliers removed with method 1") +   
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")    

#d. Method 2:
problematic_samples <- c("Sample016","Sample014", "Sample029", "Sample001") 
# Use filter function to remove problematic samples by excluding rows with modified sample_names
pca_df1_filtered <- pca_df1 %>%    
  filter(!(sample_names %in% problematic_samples) &     
         !(sample_names %in% paste0("Sample", substr(problematic_samples, 7, 9))))
#view(pca_df1_filtered)    # All problematic samples have now been removed

# Using the same code for our previous plot, only with pca_df1_filtered instead of pca_df1. 
# Removed comments to make less cluttered.
ggplot(pca_df1_filtered, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = tissue, label = sample_names)) +  
  geom_point(size = 1) +   
  theme_bw() +   
  geom_text(aes(label = sample_names), hjust = 0, vjust = 0) +  
  labs(x = "PC1", y = "PC2", title = "PCA - Outliers removed with method 2") +   
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")   

# Removing from matrix Y:

# Problematic samples to be removed
problematic_samples <- c("Sample016", "Sample014", "Sample029", "Sample001")

# Find indices of the problematic samples
indices_to_remove <- which(colnames(Y) %in% problematic_samples)

# Remove problematic samples from the matrix Y
Y_filtered <- Y[, -indices_to_remove]
#view(Y_filtered)

# Removing problematic samples from patient_data
patient_data_filtered <- patient_data[-indices_to_remove, ]
#view(patient_data_filtered)

```


Comment : Comparing both these plots, we can observe that all the problematic samples have been removed from the second plot, while the pair samples of the two outliers are still present in the first plot.





Q6. Using the code from Q4 part 2, perform a regression-based differential expression analysis between all normal and tumour samples using Poisson regression. Plot the appropriate log10 p-value from your analysis.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
# P-values for all genes:
library(MASS)

# Initialize a data frame to store results
results_df1 <- data.frame(Index = numeric(0), p_value = numeric(0))

# Iterate over all genes
for (idx in 1:nrow(Y_filtered)) {
  # Select columns for the current gene
  c_cl <- 1:ncol(Y_filtered)
  x <- patient_data_filtered$tissue[c_cl]
  z <- patient_data_filtered$patient[c_cl]
  
  # Create a data frame for the current gene
  tmp1 <- data.frame(y = Y_filtered[idx, c_cl], x = x, z = z, lib_size = colSums(Y_filtered[, c_cl]))
  
  # Perform Poisson regression
  out1 <- glm(y ~ x + z + lib_size, data = tmp1, family = "poisson")
  
  # Extract p-value for the variable of interest (e.g., x)
  p_val1 <- summary(out1)$coefficients[2, 4]
  
  # Store the results in the data frame
  results_df1 <- rbind(results_df1, c(idx, p_val1))
}

#view(tmp1)
#summary(out1)

# Rename columns for better clarity in results_df1
colnames(results_df1) <- c("Index", "p_value")

# Create the scatter plot using ggplot2 for results_df1
ggplot(results_df1, aes(x = Index, y = -log10(p_value))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Gene Index", y = "-log10(p-value)", title = "P-Values for all genes")

```


Comment: Poisson regression shows dispersed p-values. Since this data is over-dispersed and since gene expression analysis includes count data, it is much better to perform a negative binomial regression (Fang, Z., Martin, J. & Wang, Z., 2012). That is why, in Q7, I have used negative binomial regression. 





Q7. Perform a regression-based analysis to identify genes differentially expressed between normal and tumour samples including the tissue variable indicating if it is tumour or normal sample. Plot the appropriate log10 p-value from your analysis. Compare the p-values with and without inclusion of the tissue type as a covariate, what do you observe? Which of the covariate has the biggest effect? Explain your answer with supporting plots, tables and further analysis if required.
```{r, warning=FALSE}

Comment: This plot shows much better distribution of p values.

```{r}
# Count the number of p-values below 0.05 for xTumour
p_values_below_0.05_count <- sum(results_df2$p_value < 0.05)

# Print the number of p-values below 0.05 for xTumour
cat("Number of p-values below 0.05 for xTumour:", p_values_below_0.05_count, "\n")

```


Comment: There are many p values which are below 0.05, which indicates that the Tumour covariate can be considered statistically significant for the expression of many genes.

Comment: The plots show the distribution of p-values without tissue as a covariate. Out of the 11 patient covariates, it is difficult to determine which has the biggest effect.


```{r}
# Check which covariate has the highest number of p values below 0.05: 

# Create a list of data frames
results_list <- list(results_df3, results_df4, results_df5, results_df6, results_df7,
                     results_df8, results_df9, results_df10, results_df11, results_df12, results_df13)

# Initialize an empty vector to store counts
below_0.05_counts <- numeric(length(results_list))

# Loop through each data frame and calculate counts
for (i in seq_along(results_list)) {
  below_0.05_counts[i] <- sum(results_list[[i]]$p_value < 0.05)
}

# Find the index of the maximum count
max_index <- which.max(below_0.05_counts)

# Print the results and the largest number
for (i in seq_along(below_0.05_counts)) {
  cat("Number of values below 0.05 in results_df", i + 2, ":", below_0.05_counts[i], "\n")
}

cat("The biggest number is in results_df", max_index + 2, ":", below_0.05_counts[max_index], "\n")
summary(out3)
```


Comment: From looking at the number of p-values below 0.05, we can determine if a particular covariate is statistically significant. In this particular case, covariate 8 (patient 5) has the highest number of p-values below 0.05, from this we can interpret that this covariate has the biggest effect. Although in the last iteration of gene, the summary(out3) shows patient 15 to be more statistically significant, covariate 4 has fewer (results_df6 = 580) p-values below 0.05 than covariate 8.
